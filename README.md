Dropout Prediction Using Machine Learning

Overview

This project, Student Dropout Analysis and Prediction, aims to predict student dropouts based on historical enrollment and performance data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project helps educational institutions identify at-risk students early and implement proactive measures to improve retention rates.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing data, encodes categorical features, and scales numeric variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes trends, correlations, and outliers.

Feature Engineering: Includes polynomial features, feature selection, and handling of imbalanced datasets.

Model Training: Trains classification models including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.

Evaluation Metrics: Provides metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to evaluate model performance.

Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized student information such as:

Demographics: Age, gender, etc.

Academic Performance: Grades, attendance, etc.

Enrollment Details: Registration dates, programs enrolled, etc.

The target variable is Dropped_Out, indicating whether a student has dropped out (1) or stayed enrolled (0).

Requirements

This project is developed using Python. Below are the major libraries required:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn
